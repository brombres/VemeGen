[0:00.50] OFFICER 1: Team Alpha is playing a dirty game.

[0:04.00] OFFICER 1: They stole one team's sleeping bags.

[0:05.65] OFFICER 1: They bullied three people into firing their flares.

[0:08.00] OFFICER 1: They are turning a game about wilderness survival

[0:12.00] OFFICER 1: into a game of Who's the Biggest Asshole.

[0:17.50] HITLER: It's survival of the fittest.

[0:19.00] HITLER: Besides, Javier will outlast them all.

          # Concerned officers hesitate to speak

[0:24.75] OFFICER 1: My Fuhrer...

[0:27.50] OFFICER 1: Javier...

[0:31.00] OFFICER 2: Javier was forced to quit. He lost his team

[0:34.00] OFFICER 2: to the bullies and Team Charlie wouldn't let him join.

          # Long pause by Hitler as his rage builds. He takes off his reading glasses.

[0:53.00] HITLER: Fans of the type of game that Team Alpha played should leave now.

          # Most officers leave.

[1:13.00] HITLER: Javier was FORCED TO QUIT?!

[1:15.25] HITLER: This show is filled with weak men who tap out when they get cold,

[1:18.75] HITLER: idiots who drink water straight from the ditch,

[1:25.25] HITLER: and evil, scheming bitches.

[1:29.25] HITLER: There's one man who won't quit,

[1:31.50] HITLER: who sets fire to his camp rather than let Alpha plunder it,

[1:34.75] HITLER: who asks to join Charlie just long enough to beat Alpha,

[1:37.50] HITLER: and he is forced to quit on a technicality?!

[1:40.50] OFFICER 1: The rules say if you don't have a team then you must leave the game.

[1:42.75] HITLER: The RULES?! The rules that say "there are no rules except for one stupid rule"?

[1:46.50] OFFICER 1: To survive you have to be a team player.

[1:48.79] HITLER: Javier was more of a team player than anyone on Alpha ever was!

[1:53.00] HITLER: The producers try to mandate teamwork

[1:56.00] HITLER: with their one rule that cuts out Javier.

[1:57.75] HITLER: Meanwhile Alpha is bullying and sabotaging everyone,

[2:00.50] HITLER: which somehow isn't against any rules.

[2:04.50] HITLER: Rather than trying to force teamwork with an arbitrary rule,

[2:08.75] HITLER: the producers should encourage teamwork through game mechanics, but this game has no fucking mechanics!

[2:14.00] HITLER: No one was in a tougher spot than Javier.

[2:17.50] HITLER: If Javier can survive on his own, let him! It's a game about survival after all!

[2:27.00] HITLER: What ARE the rules? They are never explained.

[2:30.50] HITLER: If Alpha and Charlie joined together near the end, would all of them win?

[2:34.50] HITLER: How many votes does a team need to vote out one of their own?

[2:41.00] HITLER: Charlie voted Justin out over

[2:43.00] HITLER: ethical concerns. That was after they tried to recruit Jill, a known villain!

[2:48.50] HITLER: This show needs more structure and some actual game mechanics.

[2:54.00] HITLER: There's a reason why

[2:56.50] HITLER: Survivor is still going strong after all these years.

[3:00.00] HITLER: It's the oldest and best reality competition.

[3:04.75] WOMAN:  He's probably just never tried watching The Voice.

[3:14.25] HITLER: Outlast needs well-defined survival-based goals with rewards.

[3:19.25] HITLER: First team to make fire, first team to build a boat, and so on.

[3:25.55] HITLER: Bring Javier back.

[3:31.50] HITLER: And bring those evil bitches back.

[3:40.75] HITLER: I enjoyed watching Jordan make a fool of himself on the water, doing push-ups to show off while Angie sailed past him to win the race.

[3:46.50] HITLER: Outlast has its moments.

[3:53.75] HITLER: Let me know when Season 2 is out.
